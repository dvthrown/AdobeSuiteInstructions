# Adobe CC 2018 Downloads
Instruction to download Adobe 2018 with CCMaker on Windows 10

## Background
Before, there was AMTEmu, an activator developed by Russian developers (the famous PainteR). This works pretty well and was developed further into CCMaker (I believe). With CCMaker, there is a gui, people can click and choose the version they want, the tool will download and install the right version right away.

This worked well until Adobe CC 2019 when Adobe CC moved to a cloud based service, rendering previous AMTEmu activation not working. As such, with CCMaker, it's advised to download and install CC 2018 or earlier. You can use CCMaker to download the newer versions but apparently the steps to patch them are very involved.

The below should be the latest version possible of Adobe CC 2018 since CCMaker doesn't make it clear which version was released when.

## For Mac Users
It's recommended to use [Adobe Zii](https://ziipatcher.com/) but it looks like there is a [superior script](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdobeZii/comments/fmv3sm/download_cc_2020_old_versions_directly_from_adobe/) to use on your terminal:

````terminal
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ayyybe/a5f01c6f40020f9a7bc4939beeb2df1d/raw/install.sh)"
````
